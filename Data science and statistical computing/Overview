In this module, I developed a comprehensive foundation in computational statistics, bridging advanced statistical theory with practical, 
in-demand programming skills. I studied and applied key sampling methodologies, including Monte Carlo methods and the bootstrap technique, 
to tackle complex problems common in Bayesian statistics and machine learning.

The extensive practical component was centered on the R programming language. Starting from first principles, I leveraged modern packages to 
perform rapid data manipulation, create advanced data visualisations (including interactive and 3D plots), build statistical models, 
and construct compelling interactive dashboards to present data effectively.

Unfortunately I cannot provide any coding demonstrations as it was all carried out on a university ran code space of which I no longer have 
access to.
