In this module, I developed a comprehensive foundation in computational statistics, bridging advanced statistical theory with practical, 
in-demand programming skills. I studied and applied key sampling methodologies, including Monte Carlo methods and the bootstrap technique, 
to tackle complex problems common in Bayesian statistics and machine learning.

The extensive practical component was centered on the R programming language. Starting from first principles, I leveraged modern packages to 
perform rapid data manipulation, create advanced data visualisations (including interactive and 3D plots), build statistical models, 
and construct compelling interactive dashboards to present data effectively.

Unfortunately I cannot provide my final examination code demonstarting my applied statistical computing skills however I will attach completed 
coding assignments which show fluidity in R.
