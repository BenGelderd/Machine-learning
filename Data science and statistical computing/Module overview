This course concurrently develops two main themes:

An introduction to the R programming language: a language designed by and for statisticians to enable easy and rapid data science analyses.
An introduction to computational statistics, covering the theory and methodology which enables the use of random number simulations to greatly 
simplify the analysis of complex statistical questions.

Attached I have provided the file containing the personal code for the practical exam which demonstrates the data handling and presentation 
aspect of the module whichis more relevant to my future endeavours.
Unfortunately due to university policy I am unable to acquire the rest of the exam so alot of applied skills are not presented.
