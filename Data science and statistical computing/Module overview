This course concurrently develops two main themes:

An introduction to the R programming language: a language designed by and for statisticians to enable easy and rapid data science analyses.
An introduction to computational statistics, covering the theory and methodology which enables the use of random number simulations to greatly 
simplify the analysis of complex statistical questions.

Attached I have provided the file used for my practical exam which demonstrates the data handling and presentation aspect of the module which
is more relevant to my future endeavours.
