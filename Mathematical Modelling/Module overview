The main goal of this module was to introduce us to the mathematical modelling of a range of systems. 
A different topic was covered every week:

Numpy and Python Classes : a numpy refresher and and introduction to python classes. 
Both to be used extensively for all the projects.

Population Dynamics : The simplest mathematical model, a fixed step description of a population evolution.

Comparing Model with Data : Modelling a system is only useful is we can compare its predictions with real data. 
This project described one of the simplest method to do it.

Continuous Time Models : The first models used a fixed finite step, but for many system, one must use a continuous model. 
This meant using and solving differential equations.

Diffusion : Diffusion describe the random spreading of small particles. 
This is the simplest model involving partial differential equations.

The Cyclotron : A cyclotron a a physicist tool to accelerate charged particles to very high speed. 
This involves using second order differential equations.

Modelling Traffic : A completely different type of model based exclusively on a simple algorithm.
This is the simplest case of what is called agent based modelling.

Evaluating Integrals in Very Large Dimensions : The project will describe how to preform integrals involving a very large number of dimensions. 
This in preparation of the next project.

The Ising Model : This is the simplest statistical mechanics model: a large number of spins interacting randomly with each other.

---------------------------------
I have provided the summative project, which determined our grade, as a respresentation on the application of these skills.
We were tasked to develop an essay in LaTeX based on tasks that applied the skills we developed throughout the model, 
the task sheet is attached as debris_ULTRA.pdf.

The final essay is attached as summative.pdf and the code in the Code folder, all of which has been unedited since submission.
