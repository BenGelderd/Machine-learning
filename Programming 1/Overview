This foundational module provided me with a hands-on introduction to programming using Python. Through weekly, two-hour practical sessions, 
I developed core computational skills from first principles, with a strong focus on applying programming to solve mathematical problems.

The course was built on a "learning-by-doing" methodology, covering fundamental concepts from basic syntax to writing functions. I demonstrated 
my proficiency through the successful completion of two major practical assignments, building a solid foundation for further development in 
data science and machine learning.

I have attached the uneditited summative assignment accounting for 33.5% of the module grade which best demonstrates the foundation of python 
developed through this module.
