This is my portfolio developed throughout university including self-teaching and modules completed for my bachelor degree.

At Durham university I was fortunate to develop my coding skills through the following modules: Programming 1, Mathematical Modelling 2, Data science and statistical Computing, Machine learning and Neural networks 3. (These modules are subject to change and were taken during 2023/24 to 2025/26)

I have attached files that demonstrate alot of the skills I have gained during my degree as well as descriptions for each subject path that detail what I have worked on.
